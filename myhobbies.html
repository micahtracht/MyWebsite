            <h3>Statistics</h3>
            <p>Statistics is the study of how to gain useful information from data that has some random variance. It helps us learn about the world, and forms the basis for modern science.</p>
            <p>An example of the use of statistics is in medicinal studies. A drug is tested against a control (placebo) and experimental group, and statistics is used to discern if the drug is actually effective. Much of modern medicine is thanks to statistics!</p>

            <h3>Number Theory</h3>
            <p>Number theory is the study of the natural numbers and sometimes integers. The principle subjects of study in number theory are the primes, numbers divisible by no other numbers except themselves. They have all sorts of interesting properties! Number theory has even been called the crown jewel of math.</p>
            <p>Number theory's main real world applications are in cryptography, where it serves as the foundation for modern encryption. It's also just a fascinating field!</p>

            <h3>Combinatorics and probability</h3>
            <p>Combinatorics is essentially advanced counting. You count things like the number of ways you can draw 3 different cards from a deck. In probability, it's extremely useful since it lets you find how likely something is by letting you find the total number of possible outcomes, and the number of 'successful' ones.</p>
            <p>The main applications of combinatorics and probability is in computer science, finance, algorithm design, and more. It crops up everywhere unexpectedly!</p>

        <h3>Datascience</h3>
        <p>This is a new hobby of mine, but I really want to learn how to better process data. It's fascinating!</p>
        <p>Datascience is a lot like statistics in that it is extremely useful for learning about the world.</p>
        <h3>Machine Learning</h3>
        <p>Datascience is also closely related to machine learning, or AI, which includes models like ChatGPT. But it also includes other AI models, like those that diagnose cancer, which most people don't interact with on a day to day basis. Nonetheless, these models are extremely powerful - and extremely useful.</p>
